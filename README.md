# Data processing techniques used 
1) Data splitting 
2) Feature scaling 

# Performance Matrices 
It helps to evaluate the performance of the models 
1) Accuracy
2) Data visualisation 
3) Modeling with skikit- learn 

# Performance Matrices for logistic regression model 
Create a Logistic Regression model instance on the training set of data, fit the model Using the test data, forecast the outcome.

# Performance Matrices for ANN 
1) Creating a sequential model 
2) compile the model 
3) Fit and predict the output of the model 
4) Calculate accuracy 

# Graphs 
Graph for the accuracy of regretion model and for ANN
